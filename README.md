# InkSight

> A calm e-ink desk companion with one website for flashing, configuration, preview, and discovering new modes.

## Why It Stands Out

InkSight turns a small e-ink screen into a quiet, always-visible information surface for your desk.
Instead of another glowing notification feed, it gives you useful, beautiful, and customizable content in a paper-like form.

- **Useful at a glance** — weather, countdowns, memos, habits, briefings, and daily prompts
- **Made for desks** — a paper-like e-ink display that stays visible without adding screen fatigue
- **Beautiful and varied** — 24 built-in modes, from practical dashboards to more atmospheric content
- **A one-stop website experience** — beginner-friendly browser flashing, online setup, preview, and mode discovery
- **Open and extensible** — firmware, backend, web configuration, and the JSON mode system are all designed to be expanded over time, including future hardware design files

## One Website, End to End

The website brings the whole user flow together in one place.
Even if you are completely new to e-paper devices, ESP32 boards, or WebSerial, the product is designed so you can get started by following the UI step by step instead of assembling your own toolchain first.

- **Flash firmware in the browser** with the Web Flasher, without starting from a local flashing setup
- **Configure devices online** with modes, preferences, refresh strategy, and per-mode overrides
- **Preview content before saving** so the final e-ink result is visible in advance
- **Try it even without a device** through the no-device demo flow
- **Discover community creations** in the mode plaza, then install and reuse ideas shared by other users

This makes InkSight feel less like a kit with scattered tools and more like a complete product experience.

## Rich Mode Library

InkSight currently ships with **24 built-in modes**, including:

- **Daily Picks** — quotes, books, facts, and seasonal context
- **Weather Dashboard** — live weather with practical advice
- **Poetry / Zen / Stoic** — calm, reflective content for focused desks
- **AI Briefing** — technology highlights and AI insights
- **ArtWall** — black-and-white AI artwork tailored to context
- **Memo / Countdown / Habit / Fitness** — practical everyday desk utilities

You can also:

- **create custom modes**
- **save them to your device**
- **share them to the mode plaza**
- **install community-created modes**

## Recommended Hardware

InkSight is easiest to build with the following setup:

| Part | Recommended choice |
|------|--------------------|
| MCU | ESP32-C3 development board |
| Display | 4.2-inch SPI e-paper display |
| Power | USB for development, optional lithium battery build (recommended `505060-2000mAh` + TP5000) |
| Cost | Typical DIY BOM around **CNY 220** |

The public documentation and setup flow are centered on **ESP32-C3 + 4.2-inch e-paper**.

For a first build, start with **ESP32-C3 + 4.2-inch e-paper**.

## Notes for the WEIFENG CZ15/CZ15LW 4.2-inch Panel

If you are using the WEIFENG / Vision Peak 4.2-inch panel family such as `WFT0420CZ15LW`, `HFT0420CZ15`, or back-label variants like `WF0420T8PCZ15230H`, there are some practical compatibility notes:

- This panel family can be brought up successfully with InkSight on **ESP32-C3**.
- In the current compatibility state, the panel is best treated as a **stable black-and-white compatible display**.
- The firmware adaptation work in this fork uses the panel in a reliable black/white mode first, rather than claiming complete third-color support.
- For day-to-day use, keep the proven compatibility builds and avoid experimental color builds unless you are actively debugging the panel driver.

Recommended local firmware outputs from this compatibility work:

- `wft_cz15_final_bw.bin` — stable black/white compatible build
- `wft_cz15_final_bw_no_time_partial.bin` — same as above, but with time-region partial refresh disabled

These notes reflect practical bring-up results for the CZ15/CZ15LW hardware family and are intended to help others avoid repeatedly re-testing the same dead ends.

## Explore the Official Website

If you want to get a feel for the product before buying parts or setting up anything locally, the official website is the best place to start:

- **Homepage** — a quick overview of the product and how the experience fits together
- **Web flasher** — browser-based firmware flashing, with a walkthrough video here: [`Flashing tutorial`](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1aWcQzQE3r/?spm_id_from=333.1387.homepage.video_card.click&vd_source=166ea338ef8c38d7904da906b88ef0b7)
- **Device configuration** — once a device is flashed, this is where you configure what it shows
- **Mode plaza** — browse community-made creations, publish your own, or install modes shared by other users
- **No-device demo** — try the experience even if you do not own the hardware yet

## Build the Device

If you enjoy DIY hardware and want to build your own InkSight unit, or if you already have the parts but are not sure how to wire and assemble them, start here:
