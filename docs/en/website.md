# Website Guide

This guide is not about deployment commands. It is a product-facing walkthrough of the main website entry points, so you can tell **where to click next**.

> The screenshots below come from the current local product build. Depending on locale and login state, labels may differ slightly.

The homepage is the easiest place to understand the product map: **Mode Plaza, Web Flasher, Device Config, and the no-device demo** all branch from here.

## 1. Who this is for

- You are visiting the site for the first time and want to understand the experience first
- You do not have a device yet and want to preview the product
- You already bought the hardware and want to flash, connect, and configure it
- You want a clear explanation of what the mode plaza, device config, and profile pages are for

## 2. The five entry points to remember

### Mode Plaza

- This is the best place to browse the content ecosystem and see what the community is making.
- The current page supports **search**, **category filters**, and a **publish mode** entry.
- If you are still deciding whether InkSight fits your workflow, start here.

You can start by browsing cards, then narrow the list with search and category filters.

### No-device Demo

- Use this when you do not have hardware yet, have not flashed it yet, or just want a quick visual preview.
- You can choose a mode and generate an e-ink style preview before touching a device.
- Some modes expose their own preview inputs, such as city, memo text, or custom copy.
- Think of this page as the playground for testing content feel and layout.

This is the safest place to check whether a mode feels right before saving anything to a real device.

### Web Flasher

- This is the fastest route once the hardware is on your desk.
- Connect over USB, select firmware, authorize the serial port, and flash directly in the browser.
- After flashing, the device typically reboots into the initial network/setup flow.

The flasher page keeps the steps, firmware source, and runtime logs in one place, which makes the first-time flow easier to follow.

### Device Configuration

- This is the page you will use most after the device is up and running.
- Right now it requires sign-in first, then selecting a device from your device list.
- The main tabs are:
  - **Modes**: choose what the device shows, preview results, and set mode-specific parameters
  - **Preferences**: set the global location, language, tone, refresh strategy, and interval
  - **Sharing**: collaborate on the same device with other users
  - **Status**: check online state, lithium battery level, signal, and rendering stats

This screenshot shows the signed-in state with a bound device. From here, you can see your device list, pairing entry, and device cards before entering the full configuration flow.

### Profile

- This page manages **models, API keys, quota, and access mode**.
- If AI-generated modes stop working, check here before changing device config.
- A simple way to think about it:
  - **Device Configuration** decides what the device shows and how often it refreshes
  - **Profile** decides which model and which key the system uses to generate content

## 3. Three common user journeys

### I do not have a device yet

1. Start with **Mode Plaza** to explore the mode ecosystem
2. Go to **No-device Demo** to see how several modes look on e-ink
3. Decide whether you want to build or buy the hardware

### I just got the hardware and want it working fast

1. Review the hardware list and assembly guide
2. Open **Web Flasher** and complete browser-based flashing
3. Finish Wi-Fi setup on the device
4. Sign in and go to **Device Configuration** to choose modes and preferences
5. If you want AI-generated content, configure models and API keys in **Profile**

### My device is already running and I want to keep refining it

1. Browse **Mode Plaza** for ideas or community modes
2. Tune your active device in **Device Configuration**
3. Use **No-device Demo** when you want to test the visual result first
4. Adjust model and key settings in **Profile** when needed

## 4. How to use the Mode Plaza

- Browse cards when you want inspiration
- Use search when you already know the mode name, author, or idea
- Narrow things down with the category filters such as productivity, learning, life, fun, and geek
- Use the publish entry after signing in when you want to share your own creation

If you are unsure how a mode will look on-screen, the safest path is: **preview first, then save it through device config**.

## 5. Two things people often mix up in device configuration

### Global settings vs. mode settings

- **Global settings** live in the Preferences tab, such as default location, language, and refresh strategy
- **Mode settings** live inside the Modes tab and only affect one mode

Using Weather as the example:

- you can set one global default location for the device
- you can also set a dedicated location just for Weather
- if Weather has no dedicated location, it falls back to the global default

### Device Configuration vs. Profile

- **Device Configuration**: device behavior, content preferences, mode selection
- **Profile**: models, API keys, quota, access mode

A practical rule:

- “Why does the content look wrong?” → check **Device Configuration**
- “Why did AI generation fail?” → check **Profile**

## 6. When you want to try things without committing

- Use **No-device Demo** for device-free experiments
- Use per-mode preview inside **Device Configuration**
- Save to the device only after the result looks right

This is the safest way to learn the product without constantly rewriting your live setup.
